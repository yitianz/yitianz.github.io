                <h3> TUESDAY 11/20 </h3>
                <p> The drive from Pleasanton to Santa Barbara took over 5 hours, with a few stops on the way. As we drove, the wildfire smoke lifted gradually, and we were able to see blue skies for the first time in a long while.</p>
                <p> We had dinner at Santa Barbara Craft Ramen - the ramen was excellent, with a tender pork shoulder and not overly rich in the seasoning/soup.</p>

                <img src="img/santa-barbara/ramen_bowl.JPG" alt="ramen_bowl" style="width:25%">
                <p> After dinner we walked down to the Stearns Wharf - it was dark so we couldn't see much, but we were able to look back at the lighted nightscape of Santa Barbara. We came across a seafood shop with giant live crabs, lobsters, sea urchins, and other delicious-looking but very large seafood.</p>

                <h3> WEDNESDAY 11/21 </h3>
                <img src="img/santa-barbara/sea_ships.JPG" alt="sea_ships" style="width:50%">
                <p> We drove to Ventura Harbor to take a ship across the sea to the Santa Cruz Island (part of the Channel Islands). Spotted a few sea lions perching on a float along the way. </p>
                <img src="img/santa-barbara/coast.JPG" alt="coast" style="width:30%">
                <p> Once there, we hiked the 2-mile Cavern Point Loop, getting great views of the coast along the way. We also saw island foxes! Small and cat-like. </p>
                <img src="img/santa-barbara/fox_island.JPG" alt="fox_island" style="width:30%">
                <p> After the hike we rested by the campgrounds and saw more foxes, then went down by the beach to take in the coast from a closer point of view. After arriving back on land, we went to Lao Ma Tou for some delicious and discounted (50% off!) hot pot.</p>
                
                <h3> THURSDAY 11/22 </h3>
                <img src="img/santa-barbara/me_zoo.JPG" alt="me_zoo" style="width:35%">
                <p> We went to the Santa Barbara Zoo mostly because it was the only place open on Thanksgiving. Not very large, but many cute and delightful animals here.</p>

                <img src="img/santa-barbara/giraffe.JPG" alt="giraffe" style="width:25%">
                <p> I fed a giraffe with lettuce - it had a very long purple tongue and eagerly snatched away my lettuce leaves for its mid-morning snack. </p>
                <p> We checked out the Paso Nuevo shopping mall, then headed over to the beach in the late afternoon. </p>
                <img src="img/santa-barbara/beach.JPG" alt="beach" style="width:30%">
                <p> The sunset was pretty spectacular. </p>

                <h3> FRIDAY 11/23 </h3>
                <p> For our last day in Santa Barbara, we visited the Old Mission.</p>

                <img src="img/santa-barbara/church.JPG" alt="mission" style="width:30%">
                <p> Small but beautifully embellished church with a few sculptures. </p>

                <p> Finished off our trip with a very nice lunch of spicy boiled fresh fish and a couple vegetable dishes at a restaurant called WeCook, near UC Santa Barbara. </p>
